## General info
The world pandemic that has befallen poses strict restrictions to travelling and hence the public
are hesitant to go on vacations and accommodate in resorts. The sceptical system of accommodation that
persists in the resortsâ€Ÿ bookings and lack of precautions that are not adhered to by many resorts during
the current pandemic situation adds on to the reason. This calls for an organised, restructured and secure
resort database management system. The proposed project is a user-friendly easily administrable
relational database system (RDBMS) which aids the managers of the resorts to securely accommodate
the customers by keeping track of their health status.

### Objectives:
* The proposed project is an RDBMS for online room booking system for resorts
* The main objective is to develop and implement a safe accommodation system by monitoring
the health status of the staff and customers
* The administrator of the resort has access to the database containing the data of the
reservations, room categories, recorded health details, feedbacks and reviews received as well
as the booking cancellation details
* It is very easy for the administrators to maintain the database by creating modules and
updating or deleting necessary data making them proactive with their data
* It has an interactive user interface where the customers can browse through thoroughly and
view the facilities and packages available at the resort
* The customer can make a reservation by choosing a particular room type and paying the price
corresponding to that type
* There is a provision to cancel reservations if and when the customers wish to for which
reasonable amount is refunded accordingly
* A portal for feedback and query is also accessible for the customers
* The users have autonomy over the usage of the system
* Therefore, the proposed project is efficient in terms of its functionality and time consumption
